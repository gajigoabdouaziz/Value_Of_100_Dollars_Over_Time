DESCRIPTIONThis project analyzes how the purchasing power of $100 has changed over time from 1900 to 2024 due to inflation and other economic factors. It combines historical price indices, inflation rates, and significant economic events to provide an interactive exploration of trends. The project uses Python for data analysis and Tableau for visualization, offering dynamic dashboards that contextualize monetary changes with historical events from 1900 to 2024.The tool is designed for researchers, educators, and anyone interested in understanding inflation trends and their relationship to real-world events. Its modular codebase allows for easy extension and adaptation, making it suitable for open-source collaboration.INSTALLATIONTo set up the project on your local system:1. Prerequisites:o Python 3.8+o Jupyter Notebooko Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public2. Install Dependencies:python libraries, pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn3. Set Up Tableau: install the free version of TableauEXECUTION1. Run the Data Analysis Code:o Navigate to the code/ folder.o Open the Jupyter Notebook (analysis.ipynb) in your VSCode or Jupyter Notebook environment.o Execute the notebook cells to preprocess data, run analyses, and save outputs.2. View Visualizations:o Open the Tableau file .o Use Tableau to explore the interactive dashboards.3. Demo Workflow:o Step 1: Open the Jupyter Notebook and preprocess the dataset by running the code cells.o Step 2: Export processed data for use in Tableau.o Step 3: Open Tableau and explore inflation rates, CPI, and event overlays using the dashboards.CONTACT INFORMATIONFor any questions or issues, please contact:* Name: Abdou Aziz Gajigo* Email: gajigoabdouaziz
